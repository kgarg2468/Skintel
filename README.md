# Skintel - AI-Powered Skin Health Analysis

Skintel is an advanced AI-powered web application that analyzes skin photos to detect potential health biomarkers and provides personalized health recommendations. Using computer vision and machine learning, Skintel can identify visual indicators of systemic conditions like insulin resistance, cholesterol deposits, dehydration, and inflammatory conditions.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Your Photo
1. Navigate to the Skintel web interface
2. Click "Choose a skin photo" or drag and drop an image
3. Supported formats: JPEG, PNG (max 5MB)
4. For best results, use well-lit, clear photos

### Step 2: AI Analysis Process
The system automatically processes your image through four stages:
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes and enhances the image
2. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes skin texture, color, and patterns
3. **AI Analysis**: Applies machine learning models to detect conditions
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Creates personalized advice

### Step 3: Review Results
- **Summary Banner**: Shows the most significant finding
- **Condition Cards**: Review each detected condition with confidence scores
- **Action Plan**: Follow categorized recommendations for Diet, Lifestyle, and Medical care

### Sample Walkthrough

#### Example Analysis Result:
```
High Insulin Risk Detected â€“ Cut Added Sugars
Focus on low-sugar diet and exercise â€¢ Confidence: 72%

Dashboard Cards:
Insulin Resistance - 72% confidence - High priority
Skin Dehydration - 45% confidence - Medium priority
Sun Damage - 38% confidence - Low priority

Action Plan:
Diet: Reduce refined sugar intake, focus on low-glycemic foods
Lifestyle: Regular exercise 30+ minutes daily, improve sleep
Medical: Schedule blood glucose testing, consult endocrinologist
```
